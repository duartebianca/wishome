# 🎁 Wishome - Gift List Management

**Wishome** is an application for creating and managing gift lists, with two types of users: **wisher** and **gifters**. The wisher can create a list of gifts they would like to receive, while gifters can mark products as "thinking" or "purchased". The wisher has control over who can view their address and can track who has purchased or is thinking about purchasing certain items.

## 🛠 Features

- **Wisher**:
  - A single user responsible for creating and managing the gift list.
  - Can see which gifters are thinking about or have purchased each item.
  - Validates gifters so they can view the delivery address.
- **Gifters**:

  - Can sign up for the platform and view the gift list.
  - Can mark products as "thinking" or "purchased".
  - Can copy the wisher's address (only after being validated by the wisher).

- **Products**:
  - All users can see the status of products: **available**, **thinking**, or **purchased**.
  - The wisher can view which gifters are associated with products marked as "thinking" or "purchased".

## 🚀 Technologies Used

### Frontend:

- **React** with **React Router**: For page navigation.
- **Chakra UI**: Component library for the interface.
- **Firebase Authentication SDK**: For user authentication (gifters and wisher).

### Backend:

- Flask
- Python
- Bcrypt
- SQLite

## 🏗 Backend Features

- **Gifter Registration**: Gifters can sign up on the platform, and their information is stored in Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
- **Authentication**: We use Firebase Authentication to manage user login and account creation.
- **Product Management**:
  - Gifters can mark products as "thinking" or "purchased".
  - The wisher can view all gifters associated with a product.
- **Security**: All interactions are authenticated with JWT tokens.
